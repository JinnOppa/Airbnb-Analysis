# Airbnb Booking Analysis

This project is created for self-development purposes and focuses on analyzing Airbnb booking data using a Python Jupyter Notebook and visualizing the results through Power BI. The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prahalmendon/airbnb-booking-analysis). The Jupyter Notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps, including importing libraries, loading the dataset, checking variables and unique values, data dimension, statistical features, data cleaning (handling missing values and outliers), and finding correlations between variables using a heat map. The Power BI dashboard provides multiple scorecards presenting important insights from the analysis.

Please download the dataset from Kaggle and follow the exploratory data analysis steps outlined in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook consists of the following key steps and exploratory analysis:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2. **Importing the Dataset**: Loading the Airbnb booking dataset into the Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Checking Dataset**: Investigate the dataset by examining variables, unique values, data dimensions, and statistical features.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and handling missing values, as well as addressing outliers in the dataset.
5. **Finding Correlations**: Analyzing correlations between variables using a heat map.
6. **Data Exploration**: Conducting several additional analyses to gain further insight from the dataset.

## Power BI Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard showcases the following scorecards, providing valuable insights derived from the analysis:

1. **Top 10 Listed Hosts**: Highlighting the hosts with the highest number of listings.
2. **Top 10 Neighborhoods Property Count**: Displaying the neighborhoods with the most property listings.
3. **Neighborhood Group Price Units**: Comparing the maximum, minimum, and average price per unit in each neighborhood group.
4. **Proportion of Room Types in Each City**: Showing the proportion of different room types in each city.
5. **Room Types in Neighborhood Group**: Visualizing the types of rooms available in each neighborhood group.
6. **Proportion of Availability Room Type**: Analyzing the proportion of available room types.
7. **Proportion of Host Count in Neighborhood Group**: Examining the distribution of host counts in each neighborhood group.
8. **Number of Reviews in Neighborhood Group**: Presenting the number of reviews for each neighborhood group.
9. **Average Price for Room Types**: Providing the average price for each room type.
